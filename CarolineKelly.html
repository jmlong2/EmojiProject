  <h1>Emoji Research</h1>
    <div class="content">
  <p> In her doctoral thesis "Do you know what I mean >:( : A linguistic study
    of the understanding of emoticons and emojis in text messages", Caroline Kelly
    delivered a questionnaire to a group of Swedish high school students. Within
    her handouts were questions asking the students to record their understanding
    of emojis used within example text messages. The question Kelly was asking with
    her research was whether or not a common understanding of emojis could be, or
    had already been, achieved.
  </p>
  <p>
    What Kelly found was that the understanding of emojis used within text
    messages was highly dependent on context. Things such as who sent the message,
    how many emojis were used, what type of emojis were used, and the previous
    messages in the conversation all played crucial roles in helping the teens
    decode the emojis meaning in the fake messages. Kelly notes that "(t)he results
     differed very much when the participants tried to understand the context in
      which an emoticon/emoji was used. This indicates that the interpreter
      needs both a context and a reference, otherwise they must make assumptions
      as to what the sender of a message means with the emoji included after the
      text. There is, in other words, no such thing as a universal or individual
      understanding of the emoticons/emojis in themselves, as they need not only
      to be put in a context of whole text, but also in a context of what is being
      communicated" (25).
  </p>
  <p>
    The way Kelly's study applies to the understanding of the overall project, I
    think, is that emoji use is dependent on a system (language) that we, by nature,
    cannot define. Lotman and Derrida, in their contributions to the fields
    of linguistics and semiotics, argue that language is context driven. Lanugage
    is driven by the idea that a definition can only be made in difference. As
    such, context is the only constant afforded to all types of communication.
    The idea of inserting facial expression and body language cues into text
    conversations as a retrieval of the obsolesced makes sense, because it
    offers a portion of the context which was previously lacking.
