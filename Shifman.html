  <h1>Memes</h1>
    <div class="content">
  <p> In her work <i>Memes in Digital Culture</i> Limor Shifman explores what it
    means to be a meme in the digital platform. Specifically, in her chapter "When
    Memes Go Digital", she talks about a term that she coins as "hypermemetic logic".
    Basically, Shifman means that memes, much like Dawkin's original use of the
    word implies, copy and spread faster than ever before, but their "evolution
    as a new vernacular that permeates many spheres of digital and non digital
    expression" (23). Specifically, Shifman explores the movement of certain
    memes and the ways they are reproduced and shared or injected back into the
    group, community, or internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shifman's attention to the ways in which memes are reproduced, reworked, and shared
    back into the community are useful for this project because she refers to memes
    and their ability to replicate, share ideas, and forge new groups as a kind
    of new internet vernacular. Since memes are so heavily based on images, it is
    not a far leap to include emojis into this "new internet vernacular".
