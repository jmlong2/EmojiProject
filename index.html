<h1>Emojis as a New Language</h1>

<p>This project will interrogate a new language of response in regards to emojis
in text conversations and the proliferation of emojis in reactionary gifs on
apps like iFunny. The aim of this project is to investigate the way that emojis
act as a type of retrieval of communication within text messaging.  Further, the
project aims to investigate the way that emojis create a new digital language
within reactionary gifs in response to events on the internet. </p>
