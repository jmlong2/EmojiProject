  <h1>Emojis As A New Language</h1>
    <div class="content">

  <p>This project will interrogate a new language of response in regards to emojis
  in text conversations and the proliferation of emojis in reactionary gifs on
  apps like iFunny. The aim of this project is to investigate the way that emojis
  act as a type of retrieval of communication within text messaging.  Further, the
  project aims to investigate the way that emojis create a new digital language
  within reactionary gifs in response to events on the internet. Specifically,
  this project integrates the writings of Kelly, McLuhan, Ong, Shifman, and
  Wysocki in order to articulate what an image-based language looks like and how
  it operates in the current internet interface. For beginners, it might be useful
  to go with your gut-feeling about the emojis present on this page. Each emoji
  links to a different reference for this project, and interrogates the use of
  image-based language further. Kelly argues that there is no uniform
  understanding of the emoji, and concludes that context is required for one to
  interpret and make meaning of an emoji. The writer suggests using all context
  clues available to the reader in order to make sense of the author's emoji
  choice. Have fun exploring!
