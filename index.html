  <h1 id="hintro">Emojis As A New Language</h1>
    <div id="content">

  <p>The aim of this project is to display the way that emojis act as a new vernacular
    of response in text messages and on the internet. Specifically, Marshall McLuhan,
    in his work "Laws of Media", described different aspects of technologies when
    considered as extensions of the human body. If, as McLuhan postulates, technologies
    are extensions of the human body that enable mankind to extend his reach
    into virtually anything, then texting can be placed on the table for consideration.
  </p>
  <p>My theory is that texting, as a technology of extension, so far ourstripped
    the expectations humans had about internet communication, that objects
    vital to communication, such as facial expression and tone of voice, were lost.
     In McLuhan's terms, facial expressions and tone of voice are things which
     were "obsolesced" by the new technology. However, I would like to argue, through
     this project, that the inclusion of emojis into the phenomenon of texting has
     retrieved what was obsolesced. I would also like to argue that the inclusion
     of emojis is becoming a retrieval of earlier forms of communication, like
     pictographic language.
