  <h1>Writing Restructures Consciousness</h1>
    <div class="content">
  <p> Walter Ong, in his work "Writing Restructures Consciousness", echoes McLuhan's
    sentiment that there is a distancing that occurs when an extension of human
    ability is created and enacted. For Ong, this extension is writing. "Technologies,"
    he states, "are not mere exterior aids but also interior transformations
    of consciousness" (81). For Ong, the extension enhances the consciousness
    of humans. His description of the effects of extension are, more philosophical
    than McLuhan's, yet they are saying the same thing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ong's main focus is that of how writing restructures the thinking and reasoning
    of humans. He charts the history of language from pictographs to the creation
    of the alphabet to its modern use. Of special concern to this project is
    Ong's trail of thinking which leads him to state that writing creates an
    "autonomous discourse...a discourse which cannot be directly questioned or
    contested as oral speech can because written discourse has been detached
    from its author" (77).
