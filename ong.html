  <h1>Writing Restructures Consciousness</h1>
    <div class="content">
  <p> Walter Ong, in his work "Writing Restructures Consciousness", echoes McLuhan's
    sentiment that there is a distancing that occurs when an extension of human
    ability is created and enacted. For Ong, this extension is writing. "Technologies,"
    he states, "are not mere exterior aids but also interior transformations
    of consciousness" (81). For Ong, the extension enhances the consciousness
    of humans. His description of the effects of extension are more philosophical
    than McLuhan's, yet they are saying the same thing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ong's main focus is that of how writing restructures the thinking and reasoning
    of humans. He charts the history of language from pictographs to the creation
    of the alphabet to its modern use. Of special concern to this project is
    Ong's trail of thinking which leads him to state that writing creates an
    "autonomous discourse...a discourse which cannot be directly questioned or
    contested as oral speech can because written discourse has been detached
    from its author" (77). Ong's writing directly echoes McLuhan's theory of
    tools of extension. In this case, writing is the tool. Writing detaches itself
    from the writer, extending their consciousness into the universe, and obsolescing
    the need for speech.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this project, Ong's work with writing as an extension directly relates
    to the notion that texting is an extension of the human self. When orality
    was the way information and knowledge were passed from one being to another,
    the speech was linked directly to the speaker. The invention of writing
    allowed the author's words to stay on the page, and in existence, for much
    longer than ordinary speech. This allowed an author a degree of extension,
    of voice and knowledge and information, that was not available to them before.
    Texting, in the opinion of this project, does the same work, yet adds speed
    and obsolesces facial expression and body language.
