  <h1>Extension and Reversal</h1>
  <div class="content">
  <p> "All of man's artefacts...are extensions of the physical human body or
    the mind. Man the tool-making animal has long been engaged in extending
    one or another of his sense organs in such a manner as to disturb all of
    his other senses and faculties."
  </p>
  <p> In his article "Laws of Media", Marshall McLuhan talks about technologies
    as extensions of the body - as in a hammer or clothing are equal parts
    suppression and extension of man's ability to drive a nail into a board and
    to control his body temperature (94). Mainly, McLuhan is concerned with the
    effects these extensions have upon human communication. The extensions that
    McLuhan refers to create what he calls a "new service environment" and "deeply
    modifies the very nature and image of people who use it" (96). "The
    transformational effects of our artificial organs - they generate totally
    new conditions of environmental service and of life - these are the concerns
    of Laws of Media" (97).
  </p>
  <p>
    These are the laws that McLuhan states as being representative of Media:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What does the artefact enhance or intensify or make possible or
    accelerate?</li>
    <li>What is pushed aside or obsolesced by the new 'organ'?</li>
    <li>What recurrence or retrieval of earlier actions and services is brought
    into play simultaneously by the new form?</li>
    <li>When pushed to the limits of its potential, the new form will tend
    to reverse what had been its original characeristics. What is the reversal
  potential of the new form?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    McLuhan was heavily concerned with the way technologies influenced the body
    and what humans were able and not able to produce because of those extensions.
